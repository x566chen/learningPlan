## Context vs. Scope
- Context refers to the this keyword, i.e. the object
- Scope refers to the visibility of variables

## Arrow functions
- Arrow functions bind “this” to the lexical scope

## Use Strict
- Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
- Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
- As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
